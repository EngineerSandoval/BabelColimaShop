	<p align="justify"> <strong>The MacBook Pro</strong> is a line of <em>Macintosh</em>em portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc. It is the higher-end model of the MacBook family, sitting above the consumer-focused MacBook Air, and is sold with 13- and 16-inch screens. 17-inch and 15-inch version were sold from April 2006 to June 2012 and January 2006 to January 2020, respectively.

The first generation MacBook Pro used the design of the PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo processors and LED-backlit displays.</p>
